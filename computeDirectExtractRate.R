## Title: Function to compute the direct extraction rate from the
##        processsed products (terminal nodes) to the primary products
##        (root node).

## NOTE (Michael): Need to use the average path rather than the
##                 shortest path since there can be multiple path.
##
## NOTE (Michael): The function assumes a single primary product
##
